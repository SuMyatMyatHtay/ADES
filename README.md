In order to run the programme. Make sure to follow these steps first. 

1. Direct yourself to "frontend-react" folder
2. run "npm install"
3. run "npm run build"
4. run "npm start" 


//Please ignore this if u r not changing/ modifying your backend part 

If you modify/insert new things in backend folder, you need to use localhost for now and will have to run the backend separately for that part using localhost. (for now) 

so by right, you will also have to run "npm run build" whenever you change sth in your frontend relating to the new API (localhost).
